Week 3:

>ls /usr/bin |wc -l = 579 files


low mem usage overall - "top" command shows apache & init as the top 2 (<0.5)


TZ = GMT / UTC or Eastern TZ +5


>cat /etc/group |wc -l = 56 groups (I added four, so 52 by default)


>php ./362.php >> next # in the sequence is the sum of the (2) preceding #s
