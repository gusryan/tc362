Rails is running on apache, so I guess I am shooting for the 3.5 project:
I figured I don't need all the points left/available t get a 4.0 in this class, since 
I appear ot be trending at 100% at the moment. I trust I am on the high end of the curve.
I'll be slightly embarrased if I don't 4.0, but it won't be the end of the world.. :)

Grade away, kind sir!
